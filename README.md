Cards, Binary Trees & more
===========
Systems Engineering - Data Structures - Fall 2022

A multiuse program created as a final project for my Data Structures class, where I created a modified version of solitare where you simply have to put on suit in order from greatest to least, creation of binary and non binary trees where you can add/remove/check values, along with a map of Colombia with all the departments that traces all routes between them and selectable routes.
- Credit to abuck351 for the main card game functionality (I modified the cards, and added personal features and changing others such as changing what cards were allowed on what, and also a endgame, also removing the ability to draw cards and much more)

What I learned
----------------------------
- Nodes (Binary Trees, Binary Search, Binary Tree Balancing, Binary Tree Visuals)
- Pygame library usage

Instructions
----------------------------------

	The exectuable main is: "newCards.main.py"
